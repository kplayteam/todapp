# Todapp! Another todo app with a cooler name!

This project challenge was created to evaluate the skills of candidates, applying for a *Full Stack Developer* position.
The candidates should create a simple Todo app, showcasing their abilities to build, structure, and deploy the application. It's not about the todo app itself, it's about architecture, style, and engineering skills. 

## Requirements

You are required to build a scalable and responsive ReactJS Todo app and deploy it on AWS following microservices architecture using ECS.

## Build With

**ReactJS**
* For this project do NOT use Redux, all must be done using the following items
* React Hooks and Context API

**Consider the following key points:**

* Performance; We expect you to be familiar with ‚Äúrendering performance‚Äù as well as ‚Äúpixel pipeline‚Äù. (You may refer to his link https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering). This app is mobile-first design, and you should consider we have a large number of tasks that must be rendered in client sider (~1000+ tasks), the app should NOT **render** all the tasks at once to avoid sluggish and slow interface. The app should utilize scrolling, not paging. You have to implement a mechanism to only render the part of the data is needed to be presented on a phone screen.

**Authentication**\
You are free to choose between Firebase OR Amplify to manage authentication using Google account.

* Firebase
* MongoDB Stitch (Atlas)
* GCP
* Heroku

**And..**
* Setup a nice CD/CI.
* Fork this repository, checkout `dev` branch, when you are done and then send a pull request.
* Do not forget to share with us the demo link for you running Todapp.

_Remember we are looking at your experience in building scalable apps, so utilizing docker containers, load balancers, and other techniques are suggested._


**BONUS**\
Things below are optional add bonus points:
* Setup CD/CI 
* PWA
* Using GraphQL
* Establish a Cache layer using Redis or Memcached
* Create an API document for your services/function/api using one of the following api docs provider:
