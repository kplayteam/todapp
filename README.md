# todo-100

This project challenge was created to evaluate the skills of candidates, applying for a *Full Stack Developer* position.
The candidates should create a simple Todo app, showcasing their abilities to build, structure, and deploy the application. It's not about the todo app itself, it's about architecture, style, and engineering skills.
